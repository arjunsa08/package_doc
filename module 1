In this repository, we will examine the introduction of semiconductor packaging, including various types based on applications. We will also explore the fabrication and manufacturing processes of these types and reliability testing on the packages. Furthermore, we will simulate packaging and testing utilizing Ansys Electronics Tools.

1: Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration
The fabrication of semiconductors occurs in a Foundry, a large-scale facility equipped with advanced technology and maintained in clean rooms of classes 5, 7, 10, and 10,000 with controlled environments. These Foundries are typically maintained by companies such as Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs) like Micron and SK Hynix. These Foundries utilize 12-inch silicon wafers that are diced and packaged for distribution to various suppliers.

The primary purpose of packaging is to prepare a bare silicon wafer for practical applications. It serves two main functions: protecting semiconductor devices on a die and connecting dies to other dies.
